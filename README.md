# test_repo
To become an effective programmer, I need to get better with the Git Bash. Thus this repository!

I'm at a stage in my study of programming that I feel I can really begin to ask useful questions. Unfortunately, I dont have many ways of doing so at this point unless I want to email my programs to knowledgable friends that are kind enough to lend me a hand with my code. As far as my progress in my study goes- I can't afford to eat cereal or drink coffee too close to my laptop, as it is the only vestibule containing my progress on my algorithms and game code. This is a janky system that is bound to leaking to the point of rot and it will not stand, my friends. It will not stand.
Gotta get good with Git Bash if I want to get good at all.
